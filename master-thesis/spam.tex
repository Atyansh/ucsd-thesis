\chapter{SPAM: A Secure Package Manager}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

% Package management systems, as a whole, have to manage an inherent sec issue
Package managers present a security paradox: their job is to make it easy and
secure to pull and install code from the internet.  Uncurated package managers,
package managers that do not impose restrictions on the packages that users
upload, have an even tougher job precisely \emph{because} of this lack of
restriction. Uncurated managers have been wildly successful because they make
it easy to install and publish packages, but they have also been subject to a
number of security flaws. For example, in March of 2014, security researchers
discovered a bug in npm that would allow an attacker complete control of the
registry~\cite{npm-reg-comp}. This attacker, for example, could replace
packages with malicious counterparts or remove packages altogether. A similar
vulnerability in RubyGems came to light when a user uploaded a proof-of-concept
exploit that allowed remote code execution~\cite{rubygems-reg-comp,
github-rubygems}.
% ; RubyGems tried to patch the initial error in 2014 but had to issue another
% related patch in 2016~\cite{gem-update}. @noetzli I am not quite sure that
% this description is accurate. The initial report is from 2013 and has been
% patched in 2013. The second part mentions a commit from 2014 but i

Most existing uncurated systems focus on reducing risk by securing the
connection between the client and the registry to prevent network attackers
from tampering with registry data in transit; npm and
pip/PyPI~\cite{pypi,npm-https} have both switched to making registry requests
over \texttt{https} over the past few years.
% @noetzli do we need additional cites for RubyGems and pip switching to https?
Similarly, most uncurated package managers check the hash of a package once it
has been downloaded, a request (made over \texttt{https}) meant to ensure the
integrity of the downloaded package~\cite{npm-https}.
% TUF 
These systems do \emph{not} protect against registry compromise, but recent
research addresses this threat. For example, the Diplomat system presents a
key-based method for ensuring the integrity of packages in such an
event~\cite{kuppusamy2016diplomat}. 


% These systems are still vulnerable to mal and gov
These systems, though trying to address threats \emph{outside} of the registry
infrastructure, are not secure against internal threats: malicious or negligent
maintainers and developers can compromise the registry ecosystem for all of its
users. For example, in January of 2016, researchers described how evil npm
software would propagate: once downloaded from the registry, this malware would
add itself as a dependency to all of the infected developers'
projects~\cite{npm-package-install}. In a blog post, npm maintainers argue that
this is a necessary side-effect of allowing arbitrary install scripts, and that
``the utility of having installation scripts is greater than the risk of
worms.'' Furthermore, ``if a large number of users make a concerted effort to
publish malicious packages to npm, malicious packages will be available on
npm.'' However, embracing the dominant attitude of uncurated package managers,
they also believe that ``npm is largely a community of benevolent, helpful
people, and so the overwhelming majority of software in the registry is safe
and often useful''~\cite{npm-package-install}.

In contrast, other un- or lightly-curated systems have \emph{not} found their
communities to be full of benevolent, helpful people. The Google Play store
struggles with data-stealing apps~\cite{googleplay-spy}, rooting
apps~\cite{googleplay-root}, and botnet apps~\cite{googleplay-dresscode}.
Infection rates across Android app marketplaces ranged from 0.02\%--0.47\% in
2012, and researchers discovered multiple apps exploiting zero-day
vulnerabilities during the course of this analysis~\cite{zhou2012hey}.  The
Chrome Extension Store faces similar problems: in 2014, Kapravelos et al.
detected 130 malicious and 4,712 suspicious
extensions~\cite{kapravelos2014hulk}.  Malware and adware creators have also
purchased popular Chrome extensions and then pushed automatic, malicious
updates to extension users~\cite{chrome-sale}. 

% pull leftpad for space?
Similarly, registry administrators may not always act---or may be compelled
\emph{not} to act---in the best interests of their users. For example, npm
administrators have re-uploaded packages after they are pulled by
developers~\cite{leftpad}. Many registries are also backed by for-profit
companies\footnote{e.g. npm (npm, Inc.) and Yarn (Facebook)}; trusting these
registries to protect their users is like trusting Pinto-era Ford to protect
its drivers---a gamble at best. Furthermore, even if npm is staffed by the
opposite of Ford execs, governments may compel them to tamper with the registry
anyway. At the request of the US government, for example, Yahoo! included
custom backdoors to allow agencies to search user emails~\cite{yahoo-backdoor}.
This surveillance shows no signs of slowing (e.g., see~\cite{trumptweet}). 

% Our solution
In this chapter, we describe the current state of uncurated package managers,
using npm as a running example. Then, we present designs for a community
repository and package manager, \spam{}, that limit the ramifications of
malicious and negligent users and administrators. 


\section{Current package managers}
\label{sec:problem}
This section presents an overview of uncurated package management systems and
outlines several security challenges within these systems.  We use the \node
package manager npm as a running example because of its popularity. The
security issues we describe are neither unique to npm nor specific to \node;
most uncurated language package managers have similar drawbacks.  To illustrate
these common drawbacks, we first describe the workflow of a typical \node
developer.

Developer Dan wants to reformat the columns of a CSV file. To get hip with the
times, he decides to use \js and \node, and begins by writing a helper function
that inserts spaces on the left-hand side of a line. The function is elegant
and useful; to share it with others, he adds testing and benchmarking (pulling
in dependencies like the \texttt{tape} library) and creates a new package named
\lpad. 

Dan decides to make the world a better place by publishing \lpad on the npm
registry.  Any developer can install Dan's \lpad package or depend on it within
their own project. Some users may even download \lpad without knowing it; as
they install more popular packages that list \lpad as a dependency, they also
install \lpad itself. Users may even end up with multiple versions of \lpad or
multiple copies of the same version (due to how npm resolves
dependencies)~\cite{npm3deps,npm2deps}. Eventually, fans of \lpad start
bombarding Dan with requests to update and extend his package, so he uploads it
to \gh and syncs his repository with the Travis continuous integration (CI)
cloud service.  Now, tests will run anytime someone creates a pull request or
Dan pushes directly to the repository---\lpad will only contain fast,
functionally-correct code!

Using uncurated package managers, developers are able to build relatively
complex software largely by repurposing existing projects (like Dan's \lpad);
the package manager and registry do not impose restrictions on uploaded code.
This lax security, however, comes at a cost.

\subsection{Malicious registry}
In most uncurated package management systems, all users that depend on a
malicious registry are at its mercy. For example, a registry may serve
malicious or vulnerable packages in place of packages the users request. A
registry may behave maliciously even if its administrators are virtuous: admins
may be compelled by the government, network attackers may tamper with packages
via MITM attacks, etc. In fact, in writing this paper, we discovered a
vulnerability in npm that allows a network attacker to intercept certain
installs~\cite{shrink}; developers may explicitly link to their dependencies
with \http instead of \https URLs, putting those who download their packages at
risk. npm maintainers have not fixed this vulnerability. Instead, they warn
developers to manually stick an ``\texttt{s}'' at the end of those
links~\cite{shrink-response}.

\subsection{Malicious developer} % npm v 2: different?
In addition to trusting the registry, developers must also trust the packages
that they install, and those on which their installations depend on. This is
deceptively difficult: even when developers rely on a handful of packages,
their transitive dependency list is an order of magnitude larger---and that
much more difficult to audit. We looked at the top 20 npm packages as of
January 24, 2015, and found that the average npm package lists 50 dependencies,
with a median of one, a minimum of zero, and a maximum of 626. In practice,
this number is sometimes worse; for example, a popular dependency that many
bootcamps include in their skeletons is
\texttt{hackathon-starter}~\cite{hackathon-starter}. This project downloads 558
dependencies before bootcampers even write a line of app code. While NPM
suggests installing only trusted packages, this also does not scale when
popular packages like \texttt{lodash} release every thirteen days, on
average~\cite{npm-package-install, staicu2016understanding}. Furthermore,
packages with many dependencies may also include vulnerable and out of date
dependency versions. We analyzed\footnote{ The measurements and analyses
described here are based on a clone of the npm registry; we fetched packages
between December 6--15, 2016 using
\texttt{registry-static}~\cite{registry-static}.} all packages by the top ten
authors on npm---presumably trustworthy people---and out of 6,498 projects, we
found that 1,693, or 26.1\% have out of date dependencies.

\subsection{Malicious integration services}
Along with registries and third-party code, developers also place implicit
trust in integration tools like Travis~\cite{travis}. This implicit trust is
once again transitive: for example, when Dan shares his API keys with Travis,
he---and anyone whose package depends on him---is trusting Travis not to
publish any malicious package versions. Furthermore, Dan must properly encrypt
his keys when he shares them with Travis, since continuous integrators are
allowed to use plaintext API keys. Many developers accidentally publish their
API keys publicly: we searched the first 1,000 \gh results for ``provider: npm
api\_key.'' and found that 174 of 527 unique \gh developers uploaded a YAML
file with unencrypted API keys. 


\section{Registry design}\label{design}
In this section, we describe our secure package manager (\spam), which intends
to prevent and contain damage even in the presence of malicious users, registry
administrators, and third-party tools like Travis. \spam consists of a
distributed multi-node registry which manages package data and metadata and
provides an interface to update and query this data. \spam also includes a
client tool that allows developers to communicate with the registry.

\subsection{The registry}
At a high level, the goal of the registry is to maintain a ledger with
information about users and packages. The ledger provides the client
tools---and thus the developers who use them---with a way of verifying the
authenticity of data and metadata about packages and other users. The ledger
also serves to provide developers with a single mechanism for storing package
metadata. We use a federated Byzantine agreement system (\fbas) to ensure that
the ledger remains uncompromised in the presence of malicious actors (e.g.,
registry administrators or government mandates)~\cite{stellar}.
% Below, we expand on the ledger system and the \fbas{} that ensures its
% integrity, consistency, and availability. 

The ledger consists of different messages that record user information (e.g.,
name registrations and proofs of identity) and package metadata (e.g., package
release information). Each entry $e_n$ in the ledger contains the entry number
$n$ (a monotonically increasing number), a new client message $m$, and a hash
of the entry number, message and previous ledger entry---i.e.,
$H(n\|m\|e_{n-1})$. Therefore, each entry in the ledger securely refers to the
previous state of the ledger.  The message $m$ describes an action (e.g.,
update package) that the client has requested of the registry and contains that
client's signature. 

For example, to create a new account, a developer executes the \spamuser{}
command. The \spam{} client creates a new user public key pair and sends the
\registeruser{} message to the registry; this message contains the user's
public key and proposed name, signed by their corresponding private key. If
that name is not already taken---if it has not already been recorded in the
ledger---the registry will add the \registeruser request to the ledger. This
record acknowledges that the new name is now associated with the user's key.

There are \numMessages different messages that the \spam client can send to the
registry after interacting with users on the command line that lead to ledger
modifications. \Cref{fig:messages} lists these messages, most of which are self
explanatory, with the exception of the \proveidentity{} and \extensible{}
messages---the latter of which we describe later on. The \proveidentity{}
message allows a user to associate their private key with their public social
networks, therefore tying their \spam identity to an external identity. For
example, a developer will associate his \spam{} key with his Twitter
\texttt{@handle} by publishing a signed Tweet. This allows other users to
verify the authenticity of the developer's packages; furthermore, it allows
other users to install his packages \emph{only if} they trust him and he has
not revoked his key.

\subsection{User and package keys}
\spam{} manages all keys automatically to prevent key overuse and compromise.
For example, \spam{} creates a new user key when a developer creates a new
account. \spam{} also generates a new key each time the user creates a new
project, and \emph{only} that key may sign project updates---the user key
cannot sign them. Users can run other \spam{} commands that create additional
keys associated with a project, allowing them to release projects from multiple
machines or integrate with CI tools like Travis. Compromise of a project key is
not equivalent to compromise of a user's account; a malicious, key-stealing
Travis can only push updates to a single project. Moreover, users can revoke
project keys if they have been compromised.

To revoke a project key, the user runs the \revokeprojkeycmd{} command, which
sends a message, signed with the user key, to the registry. This message
indicates which project key should be revoked. At this point, the user must
approve or flag any past changes to the compromised project (such as
collaborator additions). In practice, this amounts to choosing an entry number
to demarcate the point of compromise. The \spam{} client displays a list of
project changes and asks the user to flag the first suspicious change, if any.
All subsequent changes are automatically flagged as suspicious. Finally, the
\spam client sends these flag messages to the registry.

To revoke and replace a user key, the user runs the \replaceuserkeycmd{}
command, which consists of several steps. First, the cli tool prompts the user
to update the majority of their external identity proofs with a new key (which
is equivalent to sending a number of \proveidentity messages, atomically). The
cli tool will then notify the registry that the old key is invalid and that the
new key is associated with the same user. By updating the ledger with the
\replaceuserkey{} message, the registry asserts that it has verified the new
key with the user's external identities (e.g., Twitter). Then, the \spam client
asks the user to demarcate a point of compromise, following similar steps to
those in the project-key compromise. 

\subsection{Distributed registry}
Our registry consists of several (at least four) top-level mirrors, or nodes
that use a consensus protocol---specifically, the Stellar Consensus Protocol
(SCP)---to agree on ledger entries~\cite{stellar}. Like traditional,
centralized Byzantine fault tolerant agreement (e.g., PBFTA~\cite{pbfts}), SCP
can guarantee safety and liveness by relying on a quorum of nodes to come to an
agreement; for example, in an arrangement with four top-level nodes, our system
tolerates one failure. Users can configure the \spam{} cli tool to talk to any
one of the top-level nodes, and users can trust its results as long as they
configure it to receive at least two signed replies from distinct nodes.

SCP, in contrast to PBFTA, allows nodes to choose which other nodes to listen
to. In combination with other design choices, this allows a node to detect and
attribute attacks in which multiple registry mirrors are colluding. This is
because SCP does not require a majority of nodes to compose a quorum; instead,
nodes choose one of more \emph{quorum slices}~\cite{stellar}. Every node $n$'s
quorum slices must be non-empty and contain $n$ itself. For $n$ to agree on
ledger entry $e$, every node (including $n$) in \emph{one} of $n$'s quorum
slices must communicate that they believe $e$ to be true. Now, in order for $e$
to be appended to the ledger, every other node must be convinced by one of its
own quorum slices. Reaching consensus is a multi-phase process, the details of
which we omit; we refer the reader to the SCP paper and Stellar core for
details~\cite{stellar,core}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/quorum}
  \caption{Example of a registry quorum} 
  \label{fig:quorum-spam}
\end{figure}

In our design, the top-level mirror nodes may employ other second-level nodes
as members of other slices. Top-level mirror nodes maintain both the ledger and
a mirror of the registry contents; they track package data and metadata.
Second-level nodes, in contrast, do \emph{not} store package data. Rather, they
simply maintain a copy of the ledger. Second-level nodes can arbitrarily join
the network (by considering at least two top level nodes to be in their quorum
slice) to add additional oversight.

This additional oversight is not provided by second-level nodes referring only
to the ledger. Rather, all nodes also keep track of a ``rollback safety'' data
structure that contains the previous round of signed (SCP-level) messages from
nodes in its quorum slices. Since these messages contain a hash of the ledger
entry histories, a signed message from a node indicates that this node agrees
to the entire history of the ledger. If top-level nodes collude to rollback the
ledger history, second-level nodes will be able to detect this; they will be
able to prove collusion by producing two signed, contradicting messages from a
culprit node. One of these messages comes from the rollback safety buffer and
one is the most recent message with a backdated entry number. 

\subsection{The registry threat model}
In the absence of second-level nodes, our system can only provide strong
guarantees if the majority of top-level nodes are well-behaved. Under this
assumption, we get availability directly from SCP's liveness
guarantees~\cite{stellar}. SCP also ensures the safety of the ledger, which
itself contains signed messages; together, this ensures the integrity and
authenticity of packages. Every time a developer downloads a package, the
\spam{} cli tool verifies that package's signature. Moreover, the \spam{} cli
tool verifies that that package has not been flagged (e.g., due to key
compromise). 

During the time when key is compromised but not yet revoked, our system cannot
protect the developers that download malicious packages signed under the
compromised key. However, \spam's separation of project and user keys and tie
in with external services---e.g., using Twitter for identity
verification---make it possible to recover from key compromises without having
to create a new identify. Even if an attacker steals a user key, they cannot
prevent the user from revoking the key unless they compromise a majority of
that user's external identities (GitHub, Twitter, StackOverflow, etc.). 

In general, our system cannot provide guarantees against users running
malicious code. However, we can attribute malicious packages back to their
authors---and, to a certain extent, to those authors' identities. Furthermore,
users can configure the \spam{} cli tool to only install packages authored by
developers that the user explicitly trusts---a restriction that may be imposed
on sub-dependencies as well. Though this simple white-list policy is easy to
ship in an early release of \spam, we envision eventually extending the cli
tool with more interesting policies. For example, we can take advantage of the
fact that \spam users are already connected to social graphs (e.g., Twitter) to
compute a level of trustworthiness. Even if Eve creates fake Twitter and GitHub
identities, she will have to cultivate real friendships in order to appear
legitimate~\footnote{Here again we can leverage the idea of quorum intersection
from SCP to ensure that even if Eve creates thousands of followers, if none
intersect with other peoples' graphs, she will still appear suspicious.}.

Without second-level nodes, a quorum of top-level mirror nodes can collude to
carry out a number of attacks. For example, they can revoke and replace a
user's key by appending a \replaceuserkey message to the ledger, signing it
with a new, fake user-key. This is possible even without compromising the
user's Twitter or GitHub accounts, because the onus of verifying identity is on
the registry itself. Colluding nodes can also roll back ledger history to, for
example, conceal backdoors.

With second-level nodes, on the other hand, our system is able to detect
rollback attacks and attribute them to malicious nodes. As long as a first- or
second-level node is not colluding, this node can prove that other nodes have
colluded. Using the rollback safety mechanism, the honest node identifies any
contradictions in any lying node's version of history. Even if all nodes except
for one are colluding, honest, second-tier nodes will still see externalized
messages which can be used to prove that the colluding first-level nodes in
their quorum slices have said contradicting things. This alone, however, does
not prevent key revocation attacks.

We can extended our system via the \extensible message to both detect key
revocation attacks and attacks wherein colluding nodes upload backdoored
packages only to remove them from their registries shortly after. If
third-party services (e.g., the Internet Archive, ACLU, or EFF) are willing to
commit to hosting signed packages and copies of signed social network messages,
they can use the \extensible message to state their purpose in the ledger. The
ACLU, for example, might say that it is willing to host this data for a certain
period of time. Then, every time a package is released or an identity is
proven, the ACLU will store the package or verification data on its servers and
use the \extensible message to state that it has done so. Such services enable
second-level nodes to verify that the ledger's claims about key revocations and
the contents of packages are replicated on the ACLU service. If registry nodes
collude to revoke someone's key, the ACLU will not be able to replicate any
social network data, since this data does not exist. If the \spam{} cli tool
does not see a such an identity proof nor a (verifiable) confirmation of
revocation from ACLU, it can be configured to treat the new key as compromised:
it will refuse to trust anything that the key has signed. A similar process can
be used to ensure that registry nodes are not colluding to conceal backdoored
packages. 

\subsection{Limitations}
Our system design, naturally, comes with limitations.
%
For example, our design does not prevent front-running attacks. These attacks
occur when, for example, a developer tries to register a user name but is
communicating with a malicious registry node. The malicious node will receive
the user request but instead request the user's chosen name on behalf of an
attacker. Once the attacker has successfully registered the name, the malicious
node will handle the developer's request as usual---ensuring its denial. This
problem is not an artifact of our design~\cite{frontrunning}.

Our design also explicitly does not allow users to transfer user or project
names to others (without essentially giving up on their social network
identities as well).
%
Though we believe that such extensions are possible, providing such
``features'' in the presence of nation-state adversaries and key
continuity---i.e., the ability to easily replace compromised keys---remains an
open problem.


\section{Related work}
\label{sec:related}

% This is probably too long and needs some comparison with our design
% Note:
% - They only deal with package integrity and not much else
% - Initial set of root keys have to be trusted
% - There is no real solution for managing dev/project relationships
%
Cappos et al.~\cite{cappos:look} identified the dangers of compromised or
malicious package managers and registries.
%
The Update Framework (TUF)~\cite{samuel2010survivable} and the
Diplomat~\cite{kuppusamy2016diplomat} package managers---related work closest
to ours---follow up on~\cite{cappos:look}, borrowing ideas from Tor's update
framework Thandy~\cite{thandy}.
%
TUF guarantees package integrity by (1) using multiple keys to sign any package
data and (2) assigning roles to keys so that one key cannot be used to sign off
on different kind of data (e.g., one project's key cannot be used to sign
another's releases).
%
Diplomat further extends TUF with a key hierarchy, maintained by the registry,
to address an important concern---how to retrofit existing package manager
design with security.
%
We adopt the idea that user keys and project keys should be separated from
these frameworks.
%
Unlike these systems, however, we do not assume registry administrators to be
trusted---our attacker model is considerably stronger.
%
This naturally comes at the cost of not being easy to retrofit on top of
existing, insecure systems.

Keybase~\cite{keybase} pioneered the idea of tying public keys with online
identities.
%
Our system uses this same idea to provide key continuity.
%
Though we do not rely the PGP web of trust that Keybase builds on---our design
is considerably simpler~\cite{openbsd}---we believe that a similar idea of
following or endorsing users on \spam can potentially prove useful in assigning
a level of (dis)trust to downloaded packages.
%
For example, if a developer installs a package that is signed by a user that is
not followed by anybody that the developer follows/endorses, the \spam cli can
warn before continuing with the install---potentially preventing typosquatting
attacks.
