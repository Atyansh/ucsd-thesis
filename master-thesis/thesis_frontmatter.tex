%% DEDICATION
%
%  You have three choices here:
%    1. Use the ``dedication'' environment.
%       Put in the text you want, and everything will be formated for
%       you. You'll get a perfectly respectable dedication page.
%
%
%    2. Use the ``mydedication'' environment.  If you don't like the
%       formatting of option 1, use this environment and format things
%       however you wish.
%
%    3. If you don't want a dedication, it's not required.
%
%
%\begin{dedication}

%
%   \vspace{2in}
%   \begin{flushright}

%% EPIGRAPH
%
%  The same choices that applied to the dedication apply here.
%
\begin{epigraph} % The style file will position the text for you.
  \emph{“Hardware is easy to protect: lock it in a room, chain it to a desk, or
  buy a spare. Information poses more of a problem. It can exist in more than
  one place; be transported halfway across the planet in seconds; and be stolen
  without your knowledge.”}\\
  ---Bruce Schneier

%  you have any) is required in the acknowledgements page and as the
%  last paragraph of text at the end of each respective chapter. See
%  the OGS Formatting Manual for more information.

\begin{acknowledgements}
  I would like to thank my advisor and committee chair Deian Stefan for his
  consistent support throughout my graduate studies, and for encouraging me to
  pursue my thesis. I would also like to thank my other committee members Hovav
  Shacham and Stefan Savage for getting me interested into Computer Security
  as a subject and for providing valuable advise during our discussions.

  I would like to thank all my co-authors Jonathan Luck, Ariana Mirian, Joshua
  Chao, Fraser Brown, and Andres N\"otzli, for all the interesting discussions
  that came out of our research experience together.

  I would also like to thank my friends and family for consistently providing
  me moral support during my time at UCSD. In particular, I'm grateful towards
  my parents for providing me the opportunity to move to another country for
  higher studies.
