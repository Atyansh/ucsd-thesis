The current maintainers, *diwakergupta* and *amicitas*, have graduated some years ago now, and would like to hand off project responsibility to someone currently still associated with UCSD.   Please contact @amicitas if you are interested in taking over.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nThis package contains a LaTeX class file and a template for a UCSD Ph. D. thesis.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor instructions see the readme or the wiki pages:\r\n<br />(currently hosted at https://code.google.com/p/ucsd-thesis)\r\n * [GettingStarted Getting Started]\r\n * [TroubleShooting Troubleshooting]\r\n\r\n\r\nTo generate the final PDF, it is recommended that the `pdflatex` command is used.  If you require Unicode another method may be better suited, see the [AdvancedUsage Advanced Usage] wiki page.\r\n\r\n<br /> For questions and comments go to the [ucsd-thesis Google group](http://groups.google.com/group/ucsd-thesis).\r\n<br />\r\n<br />This project is maintained by UCSD graduate students.  Let us know when you submit a thesis using this package.  \r\n\r\nIf you run into problems, let us know by using the issue tracker.\r\n\r\nIf you need to contact the developers directly add _@gmail.com_ after our username.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThe class file in this project was originally adapted from:\r\n\r\n  * http://sourceforge.net/projects/ucsd-thesis/\r\n  * http://math.ucsd.edu/~thesis/resources.html\r\n\r\nThis package has been worked on by many many graduate students over the years.
