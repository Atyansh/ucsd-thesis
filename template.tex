% CHANGELOG:
%   2008/05/13 -  Original file adapted from brockman.tex by JRB and RMR
%                 to work with ucsd.cls
%   
%
%   2009/03/23 - Frontmatter moved to a separate file.  
%                Comments added throughout.

\documentclass[12pt,chapterheads]{ucsd}
% documentclass options: default is 11pt, oneside, final.
% fonts: 10pt, 11pt, 12pt -- are valid for UCSD dissertations.
% sides: oneside, twoside -- note that two-sided theses are not accepted by OGS
% mode: draft, final -- draft mode switches to single spacing, removes hyperlinks,
%                       and places a black box at every overfull hbox 
%                       (check these before submission).
% chapterheads -- include this if you want your chapters to read:
%                 Chapter 1
%                 Title of Chapter
%
%                 instead of
%
%                 1 Title of Chapter


% Include all packages you need here.  
% Some standard options are suggested below.


%% AMS PACKAGES - Chances are you will want some or all 
%    of these if writing a math dissertation.
%  \usepackage{amsmath, amscd, amssymb, amsthm}

%% GRAPHICX - This is the standard package for 
%    including graphics for latex/pdflatex.
%  \usepackage{graphicx}

%% SUBFIGURE - Use this to place multiple images in a
%    single figure.  Subfigure will handle placement and
%    proper captioning (e.g. Figure 1.2(a))
% \usepackage{subfigure}

%% LATIN MODERN FONTS (replacements for Computer Modern)
% \usepackage{lmodern}
% \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

%% INDEX
%   Uncomment the following two lines to create an index: 
% \usepackage{makeidx}
% \makeindex
%   You will need to uncomment the \printindex line near the
%   bibliography to display the index.  Use the command
% \index{keyword} 
%   within the text to create an entry in the index for keyword.

%% HYPERLINKS
%   To create a PDF with hyperlinks, you need to include the hyperref package.
%   THIS HAS TO BE THE LAST PACKAGE INCLUDED!
%   Note that the options plainpages=false and pdfpagelabels exist
%   to fix indexing associated with having both (ii) and (2) as pages.
%   Also, all links must be black according to OGS.
%   See: http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=hyperdupdest
%   Note: This may not work correctly with all DVI viewers (i.e. Yap breaks).
%   NOTE: hyperref will NOT work in draft mode, as noted above.
% \usepackage[colorlinks=true, pdfstartview=FitV, 
%             linkcolor=black, citecolor=black, 
%             urlcolor=black, plainpages=false,
%             pdfpagelabels]{hyperref}
% \hypersetup{ pdfauthor = {Your Name Here}, 
%              pdftitle = {The Title of The Dissertation}, 
%              pdfkeywords = {Keywords for Searching}, 
%              pdfcreator = {pdfLaTeX with hyperref package}, 
%              pdfproducer = {pdfLaTeX} }

%% FRONT MATTER
%
%  All of the front matter.
%  This includes the title, degree, dedication, vita, abstract, etc..
%  Modify the file template_frontmatter.tex to change these pages.
\include{template_frontmatter}





%% DISSERTATION

% A common strategy here is to include files for each of the chapters. I.e.,
% Place the chapters is separate files: 
%   chapter1.tex, chapter2.tex
% Then use the commands:
%   \include{chapter1}
%   \include{chapter2}
% etc.  Of course, if you prefer, you can just start with
%   \chapter{My First Chapter Name}
% and start typing away.  
\chapter{Just a Test}
This is only a test.

%% END MATTER
% \printindex %% Uncomment to display the index
% \nocite{}  %% Put any references that you want to include in the bib 
%               but haven't cited in the braces.
% \bibliographystyle{alpha}  %% This is just my personal favorite style. 
%                              There are many others.
% \bibliography{myrefs}  %% This looks for the bibliography in myrefs.bib 
%                          which should be formatted as a bibtex file.
